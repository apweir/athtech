# About the conference

This is the third edition of AthTech, a two-day conference that aims at standardising Athletics competition technical management, with a strong focus on data management. **European Athletics** is putting efforts on the homogenization of competition data structures, building a common infrastructure that guarantees data interoperability between all stakeholders: regional/national federations, sports clubs, associations, event organisers, media agencies, and the public in general.

## Standards for Athletics

A standard infrastructure for Athletics data management will enable a common mechanism to gain effectiveness and efficiency in the process of collecting and sharing data on a global scale. We will be able to: federate resources in an automatic way; establish universal identifiers for athletes, clubs, and other entities; access better reports; track competition issues, and records; have centralised up-to-date rankings; create and publish live results; create new services and products on top of the data.


## Shape the future of Athletics

We will discuss about the European and global requirements of Athletics management systems to implement a standard to collect, process, publish and share Athletics information (athletes, teams, governing bodies, participation in competitions, results, issues and results, etc.). This event will serve as a forum to search for a common solution built on top of the existing local platforms to share Athletics information in a common way.

## Open Data

The common Athletics infrastructure follows the open data paradigm, encouraging the publication of data in standard formats and under permissive re-use licences. This will bring us successful services and innovative products —made by federations or by third parties— that will affect the sport in a positive way.


## Audience

AthTech is open to anyone. Athletics federations, clubs and event organisers are invited to present their experiences on competition management (how information is collected during a competition, how entries are registered, how/where results are published, etc.).
